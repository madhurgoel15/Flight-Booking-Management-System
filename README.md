Air travel has been growing at a remarkable rate in recent years 
particularly due to the interest in travelling taking a major leap 
due to it being more affordable than ever before. Business trips 
are a major contributing factor as well. India is a perfect example 
of this and air travel is in excessive demand due to time taken 
being significantly less. In these modern times developing a 
digital system that helps keep up with the growth of air travel as 
well as simplifying the process for customers becomes important. 
This is exactly what this project aims to achieve by using data 
structures to reduce the complexity of the problem and increase 
the overall ease of access and efficiency.
Customers will be able to book tickets of desired flights as per 
their need. They will be able to choose from various airlines after 
selecting the departure and arrival date. There will be an option 
to view booked flights and print tickets.
Administrators will also be able to change the flightsâ€™ database as 
and when required to display the latest flights and fares as they
change.
